		\item We propose \textit{InFeRno}, an intelligent web
		pornography elimination system, classifying web pages based
		solely on their visual content
		
		\item Despite the plethora of useful information scattered on
		the Web, the Internet has become a hostile place for unprotected
		people like children
		
		\item The main characteristics of our system are
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A minimal but powerful vector space
			\item An extra 'bikini' class that is observed to improve SVM performance
			\item A highly accurate and fast classification system
			\item A full-fledged ICAP-based (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) implementation of the pornography elimination system

		\item Decoupled image classification and web page pre-processing (network I/O, web content fetching and web page fusion)
		\item A fast ISAM-based cache is implemented for fast cache I/O (classification lookups, updates, etc.)
        \item The administrator can tweak classification and/or network parameters, thus allowing for a flexible setting
